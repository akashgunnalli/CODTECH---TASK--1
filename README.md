Overview of the Java Basic Calculator Program
The Java basic calculator program is a simple and interactive console application that performs fundamental arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program is designed to guide the user through entering two numerical values and selecting an operation from a predefined menu. Once the operation is selected, it calculates and displays the result in a clear and user-friendly format.

The program uses the Scanner class to capture user input, ensuring seamless data entry for numbers and operation choices. A switch statement is employed to determine and execute the appropriate arithmetic operation based on the user's selection. In addition to performing calculations, the program incorporates error handling, specifically for division by zero, to ensure robust operation and prevent runtime errors.

This calculator serves as a practical example of how programming concepts such as input handling, conditional logic, arithmetic processing, and error management can be implemented in Java. The program is straightforward yet functional, making it an excellent tool for educational purposes or as a foundational component for more advanced applications.

Conclusion
The Java basic calculator program successfully demonstrates how to create a user-friendly and interactive console application for performing fundamental arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. By guiding the user to input two numbers and select an operation from a predefined menu, the program ensures an intuitive user experience. The implementation of error handling, particularly for division by zero, enhances the program's reliability and robustness. This program is not only a practical tool for simple calculations but also serves as an excellent example of applying core Java programming concepts, including input handling, conditional statements, and arithmetic processing. It is an ideal project for beginners to strengthen their understanding of Java and serves as a strong foundation for more advanced programming endeavors.
